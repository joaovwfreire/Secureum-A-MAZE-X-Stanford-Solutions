# Secureum-A-MAZE-X-Stanford-Solutions
My solutions to Secureum A-MAZE-X Stanford's CTF. 

All the problems can be found at https://ctf-maker-monorepo.vercel.app/ . 

I've decided to play this CTF challenges on Remix as I have already been doing Ethernaut's challenges with hardhat. 

Figuring level 3 out was quite an experience.
